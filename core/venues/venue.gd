extends Node3D

## The world the studio stands in.
##
## Everything a person WORKS with -- the gear, the stands it rides on, the lamps, the looms, where
## each of them has been pushed -- belongs to the studio and is the same in every venue. A venue
## is everything else: the floor, what is past the edge of the floor, the sky if there is one,
## the air, and how all of it is lit. Swapping one is a change of scenery, never of setup, which
## is why it is safe to do mid-session and why it is one key.
##
## PER PARTICIPANT, like the layout it is saved in. Two people in one session can stand in two
## different venues around the same console; nothing about the mix depends on what the room
## looks like, so nothing about the venue is replicated.
##
## Every venue keeps the same working footprint (room_width x Studio.ROOM_DEPTH) because the
## furniture's floor plan is that rectangle. A venue with no walls marks it instead -- a lit
## border on the grid, a chalk outline in the chalk zone -- so the edge you will bump a rack
## into is never invisible.

## Registry, in cycling order. The first is the default.

## How wide the working footprint is. Set by the studio before the venue enters the tree; the
## room grows with the desk (see SessionLayout), and a venue drawn for the old width would put
## its walls through the rack.

## Set by the studio before the venue enters the tree: whether the full desktop renderer is
## running. A venue must look right without it -- a headset runs the mobile renderer.
